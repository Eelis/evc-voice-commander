- try using our command structure to guide kaldi

command handling:
- run commands that cause a window change immediately, so that auto-enabled modes work in the rest of the command
- properly diagnose bad variable references

  asr heard, and maybe understand why it doesn't understand what you said

- internal line editor with geordi edit commands
- additional bindings/workflows:
    - readline CLIs?
    - Qt/Gnome apps?
