audio input:
- only record microphone, not all output
- mute microphone while playing sounds
- cancel feedback in microphone signal
- add echo script to easily check microphone output
- recognize specific voices so that visitors can't control machine without permission

asr:
- try to get phonemes out of kaldi and play around with those
- use a custom dictionary with added/removed words
- try using our command structure to guide kaldi
    probably relevant: https://github.com/gooofy/zamia-speech#model-adaptation

command handling:
- run commands that cause a window change immediately, so that auto-enabled modes work in the rest of the command

features:
- validate config so we never crash
- "what did i say"/"repeat after me" to play back what was recorded, so you can hear what
  asr heard, and maybe understand why it doesn't understand what you said
- proper python packaging/building
- internal line editor with geordi edit commands
- line numbers in 'bad alias' errors
- on startup, let user know when asr is ready for commands
- "define type"
- have output as an OSD-style overlay window

mode detection:
- auto-detect vim insert mode somehow
- only enable python mode if repl active
- readline
- qt/kde
- gtk/gnome
